In some cases, only a small proportion of the total grant amount recorded is in response to the cost of living crisis. Also, some funders have chosen to not tag grants with \"cost of living\" where they feel that all their grants support people in financial hardship, so these grants will not appear in the tracker.</p><p>Not all grantmakers publish their grants as open data, and some publishers do not immediately publish their latest data.</p></div>.",
